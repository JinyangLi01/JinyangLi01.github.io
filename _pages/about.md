I am a junoir in Peking University with a computer science major. My research interests include various aspects of databases and data analysis. I love to make databases stronger, more flexible and more useful in our daily life. 

I am honored to work with <a href="http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/">Prof. Tong Yang.</a> in Peking University to learn different algorithms in data analysis and networking measurement.

Now I am an intern in UIUC, working with <a href="http://www.forwarddatalab.org/kevinccchang">Prof. Kevin Chang</a> on project <a href="http://dataspread.github.io/">DataSpread</a>, which aims to combine the intuitiveness and flexibility of spreadsheets and the scalability and power of databases.
