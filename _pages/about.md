I am a first-year Ph.D. student studying computer science at the University of Michigan. I work with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/">Prof. H. V. Jagadish</a>. My research interests include various aspects of databases and data analysis.


I am honored to have worked with <a href="http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/">Prof. Tong Yang.</a> at Peking University to learn different algorithms in data analysis and networking measurement, and <a href="http://www.forwarddatalab.org/kevinccchang">Prof. Kevin Chang</a> at UIUC on project <a href="http://dataspread.github.io/">DataSpread</a>, which aims to combine the intuitiveness and flexibility of spreadsheets and the scalability and power of databases.
